## Chapter 2: Text

- Headings and paragraphs
- Bold, italic, emphasis
- Structural and semantic markup

### Headings
`<h1> <h2> <h3> <h4> <h5> <h6>`
- Six levels of headings. h1 for main headings, h2 for subheadings, h3-h6 for subheadings under h2 subheadings

### Paragraphs
`<p></p>`
- Creates a paragraph - a line with text, followed by a new line with some space between it and subsequent paragraphs. 

### Bold and italic
`<b></b>` 
`<i></i>`
- As implied, bolds and italicizes text within the tags. 

### Superscript and subscript
`<sup></sup>`
- Superscripts characters. 

`<sub></sub>`
- Subscripts characters. 

### White space collapsing
- When the browser comes across 2 or more spaces next to each other in text, it will be interpreted as just 1 space. 
- If a line break is encountered in raw code, it treats that as a single space too. 

### Line breaks and horizontal rules
`<br />`
- You can traditionally add a `<p></p>` for paragraphs to make a new line and space, but if you want spaces in the middle of a flowing sentence, use `<br />` for each new line. 
- No closing tag needed. 

`<hr />`
- Creates a break between "themes." Adds a long line between lines or paragraphs. 
- No closing tag. 

### Semantic markup
- A concept that describes elements that add more information for interpretation for a web page, but don't actually affect the structure of it. 

#### Examples:

`<strong></strong>`
- Indicates contents are of strong importance; would be said with strong emphasis. 

`<em></em>`
- Indicates emphasis that would change the verbal communication or emphasis of words within sentences. 

`<blockquote></blockquote>`
- Used for longer quotes that take up an entire paragraph. Indents the paragraph quote visually. Should not be used purely for indenting text; CSS is preferred for this instead. 

`<q></q>`
- Used for shorter quotes that sit within a paragraph. Generally avoided, since Internet Explorer doesn't put in the quotes. 

_Note: both blockquote and q may use the_ `cite=""` _attribute within the element to indicate where the quote came from._

### Abbreviations and acronyms

`<abbr></abbr>`
- Used for abbreviated terms in raw text; displays a text box in browser that shows the full expanded term. Takes on a `title=""` attribute that displays the expanded term. 
- _HTML4 used_ `<acronym></acronym>` _with a title attribute especially for acronyms. HTML5 takes care of both acronyms and abbreviations._

### Citations and definitions
`<cite></cite>`
- Used to signify the text within is a citation (like a book or article). This text lies within a regular paragraph; not in a works cited area. 
- Italicizes the text by default. Not used for citing a person. 

`<dfn></dfn>`
- Used for the first time a term is going to be used, which will be later defined within the same sentence or soon. 
- Preferred use in academic journals or articles. 
- Some browsers will italicize, but Chrome and Safari do not. 

### Author details
`<address></address>`
- Very specific use of containing contact details for the author of a page. 
- Browsers often display it in italics. 

### Changes to content
`<ins></ins>`
- Shows content that has been inserted into a document. Displays underlined. 

`<del></del>`
- Shows text deleted from document. Displays a strikethrough that runs through it. 

`<s></s>`
- Indicates something no longer accurate or relevant (ex. was $995. Displays a strikethrough.
