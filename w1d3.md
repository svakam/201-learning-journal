# Pre-reading Week 1, Day 3

HTML
- Chapter 3: Lists (62-73)
- Chapter 13: Boxes (300-329)

## Chapter 3: Lists
### Definition lists
`<dl></dl>`
- Creates a definition list, which contains a series of terms and definition. Like a regular list `<ul> <ol>`, but the contents of the list don't have bullet points. 

`<dt></dt>`
- Goes within `<dl></dl>`. Contains the term being defined (the definition term). 

`<dd></dd>`
- Goes after `<dt></dt>`. Contains the definition. Visually space-indented after the definition. Sometimes 2+ terms may go before the single definition of the terms. 

### Nested lists
- Can put a second list inside an `<li>` element to create a sub-list or nested list. Within the second `<li>`, can make `<ol>` or `<ul>` as needed. 

## Chapter 13: Boxes
CSS treats each HTML element as if it had its own box of content. It's possible to change the appearance of these boxes through dimension changes, borders, margins/padding, and showing/hiding the boxes. 

### Dimensions
- By default, boxes are sized just big enough to hold contents. Adjust dimensions for `height` and `width`. Properties are pixels `px`, percentages `%`, or ems. Percentages and ems are becoming more important in this day and age due to different screen sizes on different devices. 

### Limiting width
- Depending on the user screen, pages should expand and shrink to fit the screen. 
- Element boxes must appear legibly for small or large screens. If a browser window is small, boxes should probably be set to a minimum width `min-width`, and if a browser window is enlarged, boxes should probably have a maximum width `max-width`. 

### Limiting height
- The same goes for height. `min-height` `max-height`

### Overflowing content
- If boxes overlap, or overflow within a web page and content may seemingly 'spill' into another box, there's a way to control this with CSS. 
- `overflow: hidden;` applied to a selector will hide extra content that doesn't fit in the box. 
- `overflow: scroll;` will create a scrolling option for the overflowing box. 

### Border, margin, padding
- Every box has 3 properties to adjust its appearance. 
- Border: separates edge of one box from another. 
- Margin: sits outside the edge of the border. Can be expanded to make a gap between two boxes. 
- Padding: sits between the border and the content. Helpful to make content more readable. 

### White space and vertical margin
- Content is much more readable and user-friendly if border, margin, and padding are applied to boxes. White space and vertical marginining are created if these 3 properties are added to boxes in general. 

### Border width
- `border-width` can take on:
  - `thin`, `medium`, `thick`. 
  - No pixel specifying allowed. 
- Can control sizes of border's portions with:
  - `border-top-width`, right, bottom, left. 
  - Can apply pixel sizes to this property.

JS
- Chapter 4: Decisions and Loops (from switch statements on) (162-182)

## Chapter 4: Decisions and Loops (from switch statements on)

### Switch statements
- A switch statement starts with a switch value. Each case in the statement shows a possible value for the switch value, and the code will run if the variable matches the switch value. Ex: 
```
switch (level) {
    case 'One':
        title = 'Level 1';
        break;
    
    case 'Two':
        title = 'Level 2';
        break; 

    default:
        title = 'Test';
        break;
}
```
- `level` is the switch value. If the value of `level` equals the string `One`, then the first case's code is executed. Each case is gone through until the `default` case is reached, for which that code is executed. 
- If...else statements perform slower than switch statements, because in the former, each if statement is checked _even_ if a match has been found. In switch statements, if the switch value is matched, the code is executed and the whole statement is broken out of by `break;`, which performs better. 
- Refer to page 165 for a switch statement example. 

### Type coercion & weak typing
- If a data type is used in JS which was not expected by the interpreter, it will try to 'make sense' of the operation instead of reporting an error. 
- JS converts data types 'behind the scenes' to complete an operation, hence 'type coercion.' 
- Ex: string '1' converted to the number 1 in the expression: ('1'>0), which evaluates to true. 
- JS uses 'weak typing' in order to do these kinds of executions. This can lead to errors. 
- Use strict equals `===` `!==` to check for data types. 

### Truthy and falsy values; checking quality and existence; short circuit values
- Every value in JS can be treated _as if it were_ true or false. 
- Refer to pages 167-169. 

### Loops
